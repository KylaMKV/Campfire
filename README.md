# Campfire
An attempt to make a self-hostable app feature-parity with Discord.

<hr>

I think we can all agree Discord isn't that great. [It's mobile app is at least buggy and at most barely usable, and
they very rarely pay attention to support tickets](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360051164254-Copy-and-paste-losing-characters)(the linked bug is still not fixed).
Also, they're pushing Discord Nitro to the point where it's extremely annoying to use without.
This is what inspired Campfire.

## Goals of campfire:

- [ ] Be able to actually run.
- [ ] End-to-end encrypted communication **MAJOR ASTERISK*.
- [ ] Reach feature-parity with discord(Implement most if not all features discord has).
- [ ] Outer-server communication(client from one server being able to talk to another).

*I am not a cyber-security specialist. hell, I'm not even out of high school yet. the authentication method is very weird and I cannot guarentee it is actually a good idea. If you want to see the general idea, look at [the authentication docs](/docs/authentication.md).
